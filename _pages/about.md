Hey hey, this is Yujuan! Thanks for checking out my personal website. ðŸ™‚

This blog is where I share mainly my professional life, and also some random stuff in life time to time. ðŸ™‚

I got my B.Eng. degree on Software Engineering in July 2012 from Harbin Institute of Technology. In my last year of university, I did internship in Networking Security Lab (supervised by Fang Binxing and Yu Xiangzhan).

I came to Canada in September 2012 to pursue my PhD degree in MCIS (Maintenance Construction Intelligence of Software) lab, Polytechnique Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Supervised by Prof.Bram Adams.

My research interest was in the domain of release engineering. More specifically software integration, clone detection, traceability and automatization.

I applied machine learning and empirical research approaches to study the state-of-the-art tools and techniques, as well as the evolutionary development process of software industry.

I graduated and got my diploma in September 2016. I started working as a release engineer @Audiokinetic from September 2016 to December 2017. I worked as a Marketing Platform Integration Specialist @AIMIA (Air Canada) from January 2018 until now.

You can reach out to me by shooting an email to yujuan.jiang at polymtl dot ca. Iâ€™m open to collaborations and any interesting opportunities!
